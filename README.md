# AI Translation & Legal Editing Lab (Arabic ↔ English)

I document practical samples of AI-assisted translation editing (MTPE), legal-style wording, and quality evaluation.

## What you'll find here
- **MTPE Samples (Before/After):** AI output vs. refined human edit
- **Rationale Notes:** why edits were made (accuracy, register, collocations)
- **Reusable Templates:** a consistent format for future samples

## Focus Areas
- Legal & formal register
- Clarity, concision, and risk reduction
- Arabic ↔ English terminology choices
